# Overview
The Traffic Alert Website is a simple web application that displays a real-time map with traffic conditions for a specified location using the Google Maps API. The map is centered on San Francisco by default, but it can be customized to any location.

# Technologies Used
HTML5: Provides the basic structure of the website.
CSS3: Used for styling the website to ensure a consistent and responsive design.

# File Structure
The project consists of the following files:
Traffic-Alert-Website/
│
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── script.js
1. index.html
This is the main HTML file that structures the web page and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.

2. styles.css
This file contains the CSS code that styles the web page, ensuring it is visually appealing and responsive.

3. script.js
This JavaScript file contains the code responsible for initializing the Google Map and displaying real-time traffic information.

# How It Works
HTML (index.html)
The index.html file structures the webpage with a header, a main content area for the map, and a footer. Key components include:
Header: Displays the title of the website.
Main Content: Contains a div element with the ID map, where the Google Map is rendered.
Footer: Displays a copyright notice.
JavaScript: Handles the integration with the Google Maps API to display real-time traffic data.
CSS (styles.css)
The styles.css file applies basic styling to the website. It ensures that the map occupies most of the screen and that the header and footer are styled consistently.
JavaScript (script.js)
The script.js file initializes the Google Map centered on San Francisco with a zoom level of 13. It also adds a traffic layer to the map to show real-time traffic conditions.

# Setup Instructions
Download the Project Files: Ensure all the files (index.html, styles.css, and script.js) are in the same directory.
Replace the Google Maps API Key:
In index.html, replace YOUR_API_KEY in the Google Maps API script tag with your actual Google Maps API key:
Open the Website:
Simply open index.html in a web browser to view the Traffic Alert Website.

# Customization
Change Map Center: To center the map on a different location, modify the center coordinates in the initMap function in script.js:
Change Zoom Level: Adjust the zoom parameter in the initMap function to change how zoomed in the map is by default.
Styling: Modify styles.css to change the appearance of the website, such as the background color, font, or layout.

# Troubleshooting
Map Not Displaying: Ensure that your Google Maps API key is correctly inserted and that the key has the necessary permissions enabled (e.g., Maps JavaScript API).
Traffic Layer Not Visible: Check your internet connection, as the traffic data is fetched in real-time from Google servers.
Layout Issues: Ensure that the styles.css file is correctly linked in index.html and that there are no syntax errors in the CSS code.


Google Maps API: Enables the embedding of an interactive map with traffic layer capabilities.
